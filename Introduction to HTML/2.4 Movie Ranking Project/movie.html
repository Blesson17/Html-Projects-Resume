<h3>Leo :⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</h3>

<p>Parthiban, an animal rescuer in Himachal Pradesh,
 adopts a tamed hyena after tranquilizing it. One night, robbers attack his café, and Parthi kills them to protect his daughter. 
 The incident attracts gangster Antony Das, who claims Parthi is his son Leo, a presumed-dead mass murderer. 
 Despite Antony's threats, Parthi denies it. Antony kidnaps Parthi's son, prompting a rescue mission. Parthi kills Antony and his men, 
 then admits he is Leo, destroys the Das drug factory, and returns to his life. Later, a caller reveals the drug problem persists, 
 hinting at further challenges for Parthi.</p>
